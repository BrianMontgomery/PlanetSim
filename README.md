# PlanetSim

This project was an attempt to port the Hazel Game engine by The Cherno to use the Vulkan Graphics API. 

So far it renders a house fully in Vulkan, has full camera controls, and rotates the house with vertex transformations.

Ran into issues with integrating ImGui at the time when I stopped committing to this repo. I believe ImGui was not yet stable in Vulkan at that time and I felt I had semi-successfully completed the port.
