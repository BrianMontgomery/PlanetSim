# Vulkan Renderer

A Vukan Model Renderer built in C++.

So far it renders a house fully in Vulkan, has full camera controls, and rotates the house with vertex transformations.

It also is far overbuilt. Future iterations will focus more on getting to the core of the project rather than feature creep.

Ran into issues with integrating ImGui at the time when I stopped committing to this repo. I believe ImGui was not yet stable in Vulkan at that time and I felt I had semi-successfully completed the port.
